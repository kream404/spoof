## Documentation

- [Configuration Documentation](./docs/config.md)

## Examples

Generate a CSV using a config file:

```bash
spoof --config ./configs/sample.json
```
---

## Extraction

You can also generate a config file from a CSV. The type inference is not perfect and may take some additional tweaking after generation, but it should be a good starting point. This is a work in progres.

> If the target CSV file does not have headers, you **must** annotate the CSV with headers. These headers will be the `name` of the `field` in the generated config file. This will output the generated file in your current working directory

```bash
spoof --extract ./path/to/csvfile.csv
```

## Connection Profiles

Profiles are stored at `~/.config/spoof/profiles.ini`. Example:

```ini
[local]
hostname = localhost
port = 5432
username = user
password =
name = mydb
```

> If the `password` field is empty, you will be prompted at runtime.


To use a database profile override, you can pass the profile as an argument:

```bash
spoof -c ./configs/sample.json -p local
```

---

## Output

CSV files are saved to:

```
./output/output.csv
```

This will make an output directory in the execution directory if one does not exist.
